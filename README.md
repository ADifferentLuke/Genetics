# Genetics

A library to simulate genetic evolution.

## Goal:
I have several goals that I'm looking to accomplish with this library
1. Learn about genetic algorithms
2. Play around with different designs patterns
	- Seeing what works and what doesn't
	- Manage dependencies without Spring or DI
3. Play with language features and interesting patterns
4. For fun and curiosity!

#### Fitness Functions

##### BasicV2FitnessFunction:

$$
F = [C>1]\cdot \min\left(\frac{u}{a},\frac{a}{u}\right)\cdot \min\left(1,\max\left(0,\frac{\min(D,A_{\max})-B}{\max(1,A_{\max}-B)}\right)\right)\cdot e^{-\beta\left(\max(0,1-O)+\max(0,O-2)\right)}\cdot \frac{C}{C+k}
$$

Where:
- u = 1 + number of roots
- a = 1 + number of stems + leaves
- C = total cells
- B = birth tick
- D = death tick
- Amax = maximum age
- O = offspring count
- Î² = 3
- k = 50
- [C > 1] = 1 if C > 1, else 0
