# Genetics

A library to simulate genetic evolution.

## Goal:
I have several goals that I'm looking to accomplish with this library
1. Learn about genetic algorithms
2. Play around with different designs patterns
	- Seeing what works and what doesn't
	- Manage dependencies without Spring or DI
3. Play with language features and interesting patterns
3. For fun and curiosity!
