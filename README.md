# Genetics

A library to simulate genetic evolution.

## Goal:
I have several goals that I'm looking to accomplish with this library
1. Learn about genetic algorithms
2. Exercise my design skills by trying new designs
	- Seeing what works and what doesn't
	- Manage dependencies without Spring or DI
3. For fun and curiosity!

For an example implementation, see [Oracle](https://github.com/ADifferentLuke/Oracle)
